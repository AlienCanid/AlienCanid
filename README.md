- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlienCanid. I'm a furry, and I'd like to build my own aircrafts.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, drones, aircraft in general, automation, furries, gay stuff, robots
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing because I'm frustrated and lazy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever somebody is willing to collaborate on with me
- 📫 How to reach me - Discord blazinwulf#6255 - Telegam @Evan_Wulfkin -
